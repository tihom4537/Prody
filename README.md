### Project Title: rate limiting withdrawals

Rate Limiting: One of the checks in this chain would involve rate limiting. This means that the system evaluates how many withdrawals have been made by the user within a certain time frame (e.g., per hour, per day,per month and per year) and compares it against predefined limits. If the user has exceeded the allowed withdrawal rate, further withdrawals might be delayed or denied.
